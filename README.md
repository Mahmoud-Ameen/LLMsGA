# LLMxGeneticAlgorithms: Tinder-Based Matching
## Trying out Genetic Algorithms using Large Language Models to control evolutionary operations
Our main tests and experiments are on the *Travelling Salesman Problem* using *TSPLIB95* and *PyConcorde* Libraries to generate problems and find their optimal solutions.  
All problems are on a **2-D Euclidean plane**.
