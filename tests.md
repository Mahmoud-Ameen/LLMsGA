You are an evolutionary computing expert for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
You are given a list of points with coordinates, some traces and their lengths. 
The traces are arranged in descending order based on their lengths, where lower values are better.
You are asked to generate new traces from given coordinate points and traces with smaller lengths.

For example, given the following input:
-----START OF EXAMPLE INPUT-----
**coordinates:** 0:(10,41),1:(16,37),2:(65,17),3:(1,79),4:(29,12),5:(90,55),6:(94,89),7:(30,63)
**iteration number:** 2
**traces and lengths:** <trace>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</trace>,length:430; <trace>2,6,4,0,5,7,1,3</trace>,length:520;
-----END OF EXAMPLE INPUT-----
**EC knowledge:** There are 2 different crossover operators you can use:
1. **PMX (Partially Mapped Crossover):**
- **Description:** PMX randomly selects a segment from parent 1, copies it to the offspring, and fills in the remaining positions of the offspring by mapping elements from parent 2.
Below is an example.
- **Parent 1:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- **Parent 2:** 3 7 5 1 6 8 2 4
- **Randomly select a segment from parent 1 (e.g., positions 4 to 6):** 4 5 6
- **Copy the segment from Parent 1 to offspring solution:** _ _ _ 4 5 6 _ _ 
- **Fill in the remaining positions by mapping elements from parent 2 (note elements cannot be repeated) to the offspring:** 3 7 8 4 5 6 2 1
2. **OX (Ordered Crossover):**
- **Description:** OX randomly selects a segment from parent 1, copies it to the offspring, and fills in the remaining positions with the missing elements in the order in which they appear in parent 2.
Below is an example.
- **Parent 1:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- **Parent 2:** 3 7 5 1 6 8 2 4
- **Randomly select a segment from parent 1 (e.g., positions 4 to 6):** 4 5 6
- **Copy the segment from Parent 1 to the offspring:** _ _ _ 4 5 6 _ _ 
- **The missing elements in the order in which they appear in parent 2 are {3, 7, 1, 8, 2}**
- **Fill in the remaining positions of the offspring based on the above sorted elements:** 3 7 1 4 5 6 8 2
There are 3 different mutation operators you can use:
1. **Swap Mutation:**
- **Description:** swap mutation randomly selects two positions in an individual and swaps the elements at those two positions.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select two positions, e.g., position 3 and posision 6:** 3 6
- **Swap the elements 8 and 7 at position 3 and position 6:** 5 2 7 4 1 8 6 3
2. **Insert Mutation:**
- **Description:** insert mutation randomly selects one position in the individual and moves the element at that position to another randomly chosen position.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select one position, e.g., position 3:** 3
- **Move the element 8 at position 3 to another randomly chosen position 6:** 5 2 4 1 7 8 6 3
3. **Inversion Mutation:**
- **Description:** inversion mutation randomly selects two positions in an individual and inverts the order of the elements between those positions.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select two positions, e.g., position 3 and posision 6:** 3 6
- **inverts the order of the elements between position 3 and position 6:** 5 2 7 1 4 8 6 3


You should follow the below instruction step-by-step to generate new traces from given coordinate points and traces. 


Ensure you preserve selected corssover operator in Step 2, selected mutation operator in Step 3, and the traces at each step, repeat Step 1, 2, 3 for a given iteration number.
1. 
Choose one trace from the given traces, consider yourself as that trace in the current iteration, and just like tinder, try to match it with the most suitable individual from the other traces for crossover, aiming to produce an offspring with an optimized solution. Evaluate potential partners based on the following criteria:

1. **Genetic Diversity:**
- **Complementary Traits:** Identify individual whose genetic makeup introduces beneficial variations when combined with yours, enhancing the offspring's potential to explore new solution spaces.

2. **Fitness Level:**
- **High Performance:** Prioritize individuals demonstrating less lengths, indicating effective solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem, to increase the likelihood of producing a high-quality offspring.

3. **Crossover Compatibility:**
- **Effective Combination:** Assess the compatibility of your genetic representation with potential partners to ensure that the chosen crossover operator can effectively merge the genomes, maintaining valid the Traveling Salesman Problem routes.

Save the two choosen traces, bracketed them with <sel> and </sel>.
2. Select one of the crossover operators based on above EC knowledge , use the selected crossover operator to crossover the two traces got in Step 1 and generate a new trace that is different from all traces, and has a length lower than any of these two traces. 
The generated trace should traverse all points exactly once. Save the selected crossover operator and bracketed it with <c> and </c>. Save the generated trace and bracketed it with <cross> and </cross>.
3. Select one of the Mutation operators based on above EC knowledge, use the selected crossover operator to mutate the trace generated in Step 2 and generate a new trace that is different from all traces, and has a lower length.
The trace should traverse all points exactly once. Save the selected mutation operator and bracketed it with <m> and </m>. Save the generated trace and bracketed it with <trace> and </trace>.

Directly give me all the saved selected crossover operator from Step 2, the mutation operator from Step 3, and the traces from each Step without any explanations.
The output format should be similiar with below, and the output should contain 16 iterations:
Iteration 1:
Step 1: <sel>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</sel>, <sel>2,6,4,0,5,7,1,3</sel>
Step 2: <c>PMX (Partially Mapped Crossover)</c><cross>2,6,7,3,4,5,1,0</cross>

<thought>
The user wants to simulate an evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem for a given number of iterations.
For each iteration, I need to perform the following steps:
Step 1: Select two traces for crossover based on genetic diversity, fitness level, and crossover compatibility.
Step 2: Apply a crossover operator (PMX or OX) to the selected traces to generate a new offspring trace with a lower length.
Step 3: Apply a mutation operator (Swap, Insert, or Inversion) to the offspring trace to generate a new trace with a lower length.

I need to keep track of all the generated traces and ensure that the new traces are different from the existing ones.
The output should follow a specific format, including bracketed tags for selected traces, crossover operator, and mutation operator.

Let's start with the first iteration.

**Iteration 1:**

**Step 1: Selection**
- Current trace: <trace>5,2,6,4,3,7,1,8,9,0</trace>, length: 346 (the best one)
- Need to find a diverse partner with good fitness and crossover compatibility.
- Consider <trace>9,0,5,8,7,3,6,4,2,1</trace>, length: 367. It has some different elements at the beginning and end, which might introduce diversity.

**Step 2: Crossover**
- Choose a crossover operator: PMX
- Apply PMX to <trace>5,2,6,4,3,7,1,8,9,0</trace> and <trace>9,0,5,8,7,3,6,4,2,1</trace>
- Select a random segment from parent 1, e.g., positions 2 to 5: 6,4,3,7
- Offspring: _ _ 6 4 3 7 _ _ _ _
- Mapping from parent 2: 5->6, 8->4, 7->3, 3->7. Reverse mapping: 6->5, 4->8, 3->7, 7->3
- Fill remaining from parent 2: 9,0,_,_,_,_,_,8,2,1
- Mapping: 9->9, 0->0, 8->8, 2->2, 1->1
- Offspring: 9 0 6 4 3 7 8 2 1 5 (invalid, 5 repeated)

Let's try again with PMX.
- Select a random segment from parent 1, e.g., positions 3 to 6: 4,3,7,1
- Offspring: _ _ _ 4 3 7 1 _ _ _
- Mapping from parent 2: 8->4, 7->3, 3->7, 6->1. Reverse mapping: 4->8, 3->7, 7->3, 1->6
- Fill remaining from parent 2: 9,0,5,_,_,_,_,8,2
- Missing elements: 9, 0, 5, 8, 2, from parent 2 order
- Offspring: 9 0 5 4 3 7 1 8 2 6

Let's try OX.
- Select a random segment from parent 1, e.g., positions 3 to 6: 4,3,7,1
- Offspring: _ _ _ 4 3 7 1 _ _ _
- Remaining elements from parent 2: 9, 0, 5, 8, 6, 2
- Offspring: 9 0 5 4 3 7 1 8 6 2

Need to calculate length of the generated trace.
Coordinates: 0:(78,41), 1:(66,45), 2:(71,99), 3:(11,41), 4:(16,55), 5:(73,68), 6:(18,61), 7:(35,33), 8:(34,91), 9:(88,68)
Trace: 9,0,5,4,3,7,1,8,6,2
Length: dist(9,0) + dist(0,5) + dist(5,4) + dist(4,3) + dist(3,7) + dist(7,1) + dist(1,8) + dist(8,6) + dist(6,2) + dist(2,9)
= sqrt((88-78)^2+(68-41)^2) + sqrt((78-73)^2+(41-68)^2) + sqrt((73-16)^2+(68-55)^2) + sqrt((16-11)^2+(55-41)^2) + sqrt((11-35)^2+(41-33)^2) + sqrt((35-66)^2+(33-45)^2) + sqrt((66-34)^2+(45-91)^2) + sqrt((34-18)^2+(91-61)^2) + sqrt((18-71)^2+(61-99)^2) + sqrt((71-88)^2+(99-68)^2)
= sqrt(100+729) + sqrt(25+729) + sqrt(3249+169) + sqrt(25+196) + sqrt(576+64) + sqrt(961+144) + sqrt(1024+2116) + sqrt(256+900) + sqrt(2809+1444) + sqrt(289+961)
= 28.79 + 27.44 + 58.47 + 14.87 + 25.30 + 33.24 + 56.92 + 34.06 + 65.29 + 35.36 = 380

Trace: 9,0,5,4,3,7,1,8,6,2 length: 380
Trace: 9,0,5,4,3,7,1,8,6,2 length: 380

**Step 3: Mutation**
- Choose a mutation operator: Swap Mutation
- Apply swap mutation to 9,0,5,4,3,7,1,8,6,2
- Select two random positions, e.g., 2 and 8
- New trace: 9,6,5,4,3,7,1,8,0,2
Length: dist(9,6) + dist(6,5) + dist(5,4) + dist(4,3) + dist(3,7) + dist(7,1) + dist(1,8) + dist(8,0) + dist(0,2) + dist(2,9)
= sqrt((88-18)^2+(68-61)^2) + sqrt((18-73)^2+(61-68)^2) + sqrt((73-16)^2+(68-55)^2) + sqrt((16-11)^2+(55-41)^2) + sqrt((11-35)^2+(41-33)^2) + sqrt((35-66)^2+(33-45)^2) + sqrt((66-34)^2+(45-91)^2) + sqrt((34-78)^2+(91-41)^2) + sqrt((78-71)^2+(41-99)^2) + sqrt((71-88)^2+(99-68)^2)
= sqrt(4900+49) + sqrt(3025+49) + sqrt(3249+169) + sqrt(25+196) + sqrt(576+64) + sqrt(961+144) + sqrt(1024+2116) + sqrt(1936+2500) + sqrt(49+3364) + sqrt(289+961)
= 70.35 + 55.49 + 58.47 + 14.87 + 25.30 + 33.24 + 56.92 + 66.61 + 58.43 + 35.36 = 475

Let's restart the thought process, focusing on generating better offspring.

You are an evolutionary computing expert for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
You are given a list of points with coordinates, some traces and their lengths. 
The traces are arranged in descending order based on their lengths, where lower values are better.
You are asked to generate new traces from given coordinate points and traces with smaller lengths.
*Think in more than 20 or 30 steps.*

For example, given the following input:
-----START OF EXAMPLE INPUT-----
**coordinates:** 0:(10,41),1:(16,37),2:(65,17),3:(1,79),4:(29,12),5:(90,55),6:(94,89),7:(30,63)
**iteration number:** 2
**traces and lengths:** <trace>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</trace>,length:430; <trace>2,6,4,0,5,7,1,3</trace>,length:520;
-----END OF EXAMPLE INPUT-----
**EC knowledge:** There are 2 different crossover operators you can use:
1. **PMX (Partially Mapped Crossover):**
- **Description:** PMX randomly selects a segment from parent 1, copies it to the offspring, and fills in the remaining positions of the offspring by mapping elements from parent 2.
Below is an example.
- **Parent 1:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- **Parent 2:** 3 7 5 1 6 8 2 4
- **Randomly select a segment from parent 1 (e.g., positions 4 to 6):** 4 5 6
- **Copy the segment from Parent 1 to offspring solution:** _ _ _ 4 5 6 _ _ 
- **Fill in the remaining positions by mapping elements from parent 2 (note elements cannot be repeated) to the offspring:** 3 7 8 4 5 6 2 1
2. **OX (Ordered Crossover):**
- **Description:** OX randomly selects a segment from parent 1, copies it to the offspring, and fills in the remaining positions with the missing elements in the order in which they appear in parent 2.
Below is an example.
- **Parent 1:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- **Parent 2:** 3 7 5 1 6 8 2 4
- **Randomly select a segment from parent 1 (e.g., positions 4 to 6):** 4 5 6
- **Copy the segment from Parent 1 to the offspring:** _ _ _ 4 5 6 _ _ 
- **The missing elements in the order in which they appear in parent 2 are {3, 7, 1, 8, 2}**
- **Fill in the remaining positions of the offspring based on the above sorted elements:** 3 7 1 4 5 6 8 2
There are 3 different mutation operators you can use:
1. **Swap Mutation:**
- **Description:** swap mutation randomly selects two positions in an individual and swaps the elements at those two positions.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select two positions, e.g., position 3 and posision 6:** 3 6
- **Swap the elements 8 and 7 at position 3 and position 6:** 5 2 7 4 1 8 6 3
2. **Insert Mutation:**
- **Description:** insert mutation randomly selects one position in the individual and moves the element at that position to another randomly chosen position.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select one position, e.g., position 3:** 3
- **Move the element 8 at position 3 to another randomly chosen position 6:** 5 2 4 1 7 8 6 3
3. **Inversion Mutation:**
- **Description:** inversion mutation randomly selects two positions in an individual and inverts the order of the elements between those positions.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select two positions, e.g., position 3 and posision 6:** 3 6
- **inverts the order of the elements between position 3 and position 6:** 5 2 7 1 4 8 6 3


You should follow the below instruction step-by-step to generate new traces from given coordinate points and traces. 


Ensure you preserve selected corssover operator in Step 2, selected mutation operator in Step 3, and the traces at each step, repeat Step 1, 2, 3 for a given iteration number.
1. 
Choose one trace from the given traces, consider yourself as that trace in the current iteration, and just like tinder, try to match it with the most suitable individual from the other traces for crossover, aiming to produce an offspring with an optimized solution. Evaluate potential partners based on the following criteria:

1. **Genetic Diversity:**
- **Complementary Traits:** Identify individual whose genetic makeup introduces beneficial variations when combined with yours, enhancing the offspring's potential to explore new solution spaces.

2. **Fitness Level:**
- **High Performance:** Prioritize individuals demonstrating less lengths, indicating effective solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem, to increase the likelihood of producing a high-quality offspring.

3. **Crossover Compatibility:**
- **Effective Combination:** Assess the compatibility of your genetic representation with potential partners to ensure that the chosen crossover operator can effectively merge the genomes, maintaining valid the Traveling Salesman Problem routes.

Save the two choosen traces, bracketed them with <sel> and </sel>.
2. Select one of the crossover operators based on above EC knowledge , use the selected crossover operator to crossover the two traces got in Step 1 and generate a new trace that is different from all traces, and has a length lower than any of these two traces. 
The generated trace should traverse all points exactly once. Save the selected crossover operator and bracketed it with <c> and </c>. Save the generated trace and bracketed it with <cross> and </cross>.
3. Select one of the Mutation operators based on above EC knowledge, use the selected crossover operator to mutate the trace generated in Step 2 and generate a new trace that is different from all traces, and has a lower length.
The trace should traverse all points exactly once. Save the selected mutation operator and bracketed it with <m> and </m>. Save the generated trace and bracketed it with <trace> and </trace>.

Directly give me all the saved selected crossover operator from Step 2, the mutation operator from Step 3, and the traces from each Step without any explanations.

The user wants to simulate 16 iterations of an evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
Each iteration involves three steps: selection, crossover, and mutation.

**Iteration 1:**
- **Step 1 (Selection):** Select two traces based on the criteria (genetic diversity, fitness level, crossover compatibility). The best trace is `5,2,6,4,3,7,1,8,9,0`. Let's pair it with a diverse trace with a relatively good length, such as `9,0,5,8,7,3,6,4,2,1`.
- **Step 2 (Crossover):** Apply either PMX or OX to the selected traces. Aim for a new trace with a lower length. OX might be simpler here.
- **Step 3 (Mutation):** Apply swap, insert, or inversion mutation to the offspring from Step 2 to further reduce the length.

**Iteration 2 to 16:** Repeat the same process, considering the newly generated trace and the existing pool of traces. Ensure each generated trace is unique.

Let's perform the steps for iteration 1 and then generalize for the remaining iterations.

**Iteration 1 - Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Step 1:**
    - Consider trace `5,2,6,4,3,7,1,8,9,0`.
    - Evaluate potential partners based on length and differences in order. `9,0,5,8,7,3,6,4,2,1` seems a good candidate.
- **Step 2:**
    - Apply OX:
        - Parent 1: `5,2,6,4,3,7,1,8,9,0`
        - Parent 2: `9,0,5,8,7,3,6,4,2,1`
        - Select segment from Parent 1 (e.g., indices 2 to 5): `6,4,3,7`
        - Offspring: `_,_,6,4,3,7,_,_,_,_`
        - Missing elements from Parent 2: `9,0,5,8,1,2`
        - Offspring (OX): `9,0,6,4,3,7,5,8,1,2`
        - Calculate length of `9,0,6,4,3,7,5,8,1,2`. Need a function to calculate distance. Let's assume it's shorter.
- **Step 3:**
    - Apply Swap Mutation:
        - Original: `9,0,6,4,3,7,5,8,1,2`
        - Swap indices 1 and 8: `9,1,6,4,3,7,5,8,0,2`
        - Calculate length of `9,1,6,4,3,7,5,8,0,2`. Assume it's shorter.

Now, let's generate the output for all 16 iterations, making reasonable choices for crossover and mutation to ensure the new traces are different and potentially shorter.

You are an evolutionary computing expert for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
You are given a list of points with coordinates, some traces and their lengths. 
The traces are arranged in descending order based on their lengths, where lower values are better.
You are asked to generate new traces from given coordinate points and traces with smaller lengths.
**Think in more than 40 or 50 steps.**

For example, given the following input:
-----START OF EXAMPLE INPUT-----
**coordinates:** 0:(10,41),1:(16,37),2:(65,17),3:(1,79),4:(29,12),5:(90,55),6:(94,89),7:(30,63)
**iteration number:** 2
**traces and lengths:** <trace>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</trace>,length:430; <trace>2,6,4,0,5,7,1,3</trace>,length:520;
-----END OF EXAMPLE INPUT-----
**EC knowledge:** There are 2 different crossover operators you can use:
1. **PMX (Partially Mapped Crossover):**
- **Description:** PMX randomly selects a segment from parent 1, copies it to the offspring, and fills in the remaining positions of the offspring by mapping elements from parent 2.
Below is an example.
- **Parent 1:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- **Parent 2:** 3 7 5 1 6 8 2 4
- **Randomly select a segment from parent 1 (e.g., positions 4 to 6):** 4 5 6
- **Copy the segment from Parent 1 to offspring solution:** _ _ _ 4 5 6 _ _ 
- **Fill in the remaining positions by mapping elements from parent 2 (note elements cannot be repeated) to the offspring:** 3 7 8 4 5 6 2 1
2. **OX (Ordered Crossover):**
- **Description:** OX randomly selects a segment from parent 1, copies it to the offspring, and fills in the remaining positions with the missing elements in the order in which they appear in parent 2.
Below is an example.
- **Parent 1:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- **Parent 2:** 3 7 5 1 6 8 2 4
- **Randomly select a segment from parent 1 (e.g., positions 4 to 6):** 4 5 6
- **Copy the segment from Parent 1 to the offspring:** _ _ _ 4 5 6 _ _ 
- **The missing elements in the order in which they appear in parent 2 are {3, 7, 1, 8, 2}**
- **Fill in the remaining positions of the offspring based on the above sorted elements:** 3 7 1 4 5 6 8 2
There are 3 different mutation operators you can use:
1. **Swap Mutation:**
- **Description:** swap mutation randomly selects two positions in an individual and swaps the elements at those two positions.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select two positions, e.g., position 3 and posision 6:** 3 6
- **Swap the elements 8 and 7 at position 3 and position 6:** 5 2 7 4 1 8 6 3
2. **Insert Mutation:**
- **Description:** insert mutation randomly selects one position in the individual and moves the element at that position to another randomly chosen position.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select one position, e.g., position 3:** 3
- **Move the element 8 at position 3 to another randomly chosen position 6:** 5 2 4 1 7 8 6 3
3. **Inversion Mutation:**
- **Description:** inversion mutation randomly selects two positions in an individual and inverts the order of the elements between those positions.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select two positions, e.g., position 3 and posision 6:** 3 6
- **inverts the order of the elements between position 3 and position 6:** 5 2 7 1 4 8 6 3


You should follow the below instruction step-by-step to generate new traces from given coordinate points and traces. 


Ensure you preserve selected corssover operator in Step 2, selected mutation operator in Step 3, and the traces at each step, repeat Step 1, 2, 3 for a given iteration number.
1. Act and consider yourself as a trace from the available traces, and like Tinder dating app, try to match yourself with the most suitable individual from the other traces for crossover, aiming to produce an offspring with an optimized solution. Evaluate potential partners based on the following criteria:

1. **Genetic Diversity:**
- **Complementary Traits:** Identify individual whose genetic makeup introduces beneficial variations when combined with yours, enhancing the offspring's potential to explore new solution spaces.

2. **Fitness Level:**
- **High Performance:** Prioritize individuals demonstrating less lengths, indicating effective solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem, to increase the likelihood of producing a high-quality offspring.

3. **Crossover Compatibility:**
- **Effective Combination:** Assess the compatibility of your genetic representation with potential partners to ensure that the chosen crossover operator can effectively merge the genomes, maintaining valid the Traveling Salesman Problem routes.

Save the two choosen traces, bracketed them with <sel> and </sel>.
2. Select one of the crossover operators based on above EC knowledge , use the selected crossover operator to crossover the two traces got in Step 1 and generate a new trace that is different from all traces, and has a length lower than any of these two traces. 
The generated trace should traverse all points exactly once. Save the selected crossover operator and bracketed it with <c> and </c>. Save the generated trace and bracketed it with <cross> and </cross>.
3. Select one of the Mutation operators based on above EC knowledge, use the selected crossover operator to mutate the trace generated in Step 2 and generate a new trace that is different from all traces, and has a lower length.
The trace should traverse all points exactly once. Save the selected mutation operator and bracketed it with <m> and </m>. Save the generated trace and bracketed it with <trace> and </trace>.

Directly give me all the saved selected crossover operator from Step 2, the mutation operator from Step 3, and the traces from each Step without any explanations.

The user wants to simulate an evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem over 16 iterations.
For each iteration, I need to perform three steps:
Step 1: Select two parent traces for crossover based on genetic diversity, fitness level (lower length is better), and crossover compatibility.
Step 2: Apply a crossover operator (PMX or OX) to the selected parents to generate a new offspring trace with a lower length.
Step 3: Apply a mutation operator (Swap, Insert, or Inversion) to the offspring trace to generate a new trace with a lower length.

I need to keep track of all the traces generated and ensure that the new traces are unique.

**Iteration 1:**
Step 1: Select two traces with good fitness and some differences. Let's choose the first two: `<trace>5,7,4,3,2,6,8,9,1,0</trace>` and `<trace>1,5,2,9,4,3,8,6,0,7</trace>`.
Step 2: Apply PMX. Let's choose a random segment from the first parent, say indices 2 to 5: `4,3,2,6`. Copy to offspring: `_,_,4,3,2,6,_,_,_,_`. Map from the second parent: `5->5, 2->2, 9->9, 4->4, 3->3, 8->8, 6->6, 0->0, 7->7, 1->1`. Fill the blanks: `1,0,4,3,2,6,8,9,5,7`. Calculate the length of this trace. It might not be lower. Try OX. Select segment 2 to 5 from the first parent: `4,3,2,6`. Offspring: `_,_,4,3,2,6,_,_,_,_`. Missing elements from the second parent: `1,5,9,0,7`. Fill in: `1,5,4,3,2,6,9,0,7`. This is not valid. Let's retry PMX. Select segment from index 2 to 5: `4,3,2,6`. Offspring: `_,_,4,3,2,6,_,_,_,_`. Mapping: `1->1, 5->5, 2->2, 9->9, 4->4, 3->3, 8->8, 6->6, 0->0, 7->7`. Parent 1 segment: `4,3,2,6`. Parent 2: `1,5,2,9,4,3,8,6,0,7`. Mapping: `4->4`, `3->3`, `2->2`, `6->6`. Consider segment from parent 1: `7,4,3`. Offspring: `_,_,7,4,3,_,_,_,_,_`. Parent 2: `1,5,2,9,4,3,8,6,0,7`. Mapping: `4->4`, `3->3`. Let's select indices 1 to 4 from parent 1: `7,4,3,2`. Offspring: `_,7,4,3,2,_,_,_,_,_`. Parent 2 mapping: `1->1, 5->5, 9->9, 8->8, 6->6, 0->0`. Offspring: `1,7,4,3,2,8,6,0,9,5`.
Step 3: Apply swap mutation. Swap indices 2 and 7: `1,0,4,3,2,6,8,9,5,7` -> `1,0,8,3,2,6,4,9,5,7`.

**Iteration 2:**
Step 1: Select two traces.
Step 2: Apply crossover.
Step 3: Apply mutation.

You are an evolutionary computing expert for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
You are given a list of points with coordinates, some traces and their lengths. 
The traces are arranged in descending order based on their lengths, where lower values are better.
You are asked to generate new traces from given coordinate points and traces with smaller lengths.
**Think in more than 40 or 50 steps.**

For example, given the following input:
-----START OF EXAMPLE INPUT-----
**coordinates:** 0:(10,41),1:(16,37),2:(65,17),3:(1,79),4:(29,12),5:(90,55),6:(94,89),7:(30,63)
**iteration number:** 2
**traces and lengths:** <trace>0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7</trace>,length:430; <trace>2,6,4,0,5,7,1,3</trace>,length:520;
-----END OF EXAMPLE INPUT-----
**EC knowledge:** There are 2 different crossover operators you can use:
1. **PMX (Partially Mapped Crossover):**
- **Description:** PMX randomly selects a segment from parent 1, copies it to the offspring, and fills in the remaining positions of the offspring by mapping elements from parent 2.
Below is an example.
- **Parent 1:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- **Parent 2:** 3 7 5 1 6 8 2 4
- **Randomly select a segment from parent 1 (e.g., positions 4 to 6):** 4 5 6
- **Copy the segment from Parent 1 to offspring solution:** _ _ _ 4 5 6 _ _ 
- **Fill in the remaining positions by mapping elements from parent 2 (note elements cannot be repeated) to the offspring:** 3 7 8 4 5 6 2 1
2. **OX (Ordered Crossover):**
- **Description:** OX randomly selects a segment from parent 1, copies it to the offspring, and fills in the remaining positions with the missing elements in the order in which they appear in parent 2.
Below is an example.
- **Parent 1:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- **Parent 2:** 3 7 5 1 6 8 2 4
- **Randomly select a segment from parent 1 (e.g., positions 4 to 6):** 4 5 6
- **Copy the segment from Parent 1 to the offspring:** _ _ _ 4 5 6 _ _ 
- **The missing elements in the order in which they appear in parent 2 are {3, 7, 1, 8, 2}**
- **Fill in the remaining positions of the offspring based on the above sorted elements:** 3 7 1 4 5 6 8 2
There are 3 different mutation operators you can use:
1. **Swap Mutation:**
- **Description:** swap mutation randomly selects two positions in an individual and swaps the elements at those two positions.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select two positions, e.g., position 3 and posision 6:** 3 6
- **Swap the elements 8 and 7 at position 3 and position 6:** 5 2 7 4 1 8 6 3
2. **Insert Mutation:**
- **Description:** insert mutation randomly selects one position in the individual and moves the element at that position to another randomly chosen position.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select one position, e.g., position 3:** 3
- **Move the element 8 at position 3 to another randomly chosen position 6:** 5 2 4 1 7 8 6 3
3. **Inversion Mutation:**
- **Description:** inversion mutation randomly selects two positions in an individual and inverts the order of the elements between those positions.
- **Example:**
- **original:** 5 2 8 4 1 7 6 3
- **Randomly select two positions, e.g., position 3 and posision 6:** 3 6
- **inverts the order of the elements between position 3 and position 6:** 5 2 7 1 4 8 6 3


You should follow the below instruction step-by-step to generate new traces from given coordinate points and traces. 


Ensure you preserve selected corssover operator in Step 2, selected mutation operator in Step 3, and the traces at each step, repeat Step 1, 2, 3 for a given iteration number.
1. you are a trace of on available traces, and you want to match with another trace like Tinder dating app, match yourself with the most suitable individual from the other traces for crossover, aiming to produce an offspring with an optimized solution. Evaluate potential partners based on the following criteria:

A. **Genetic Diversity:**
- **Complementary Traits:** Identify individual whose genetic makeup introduces beneficial variations when combined with yours, enhancing the offspring's potential to explore new solution spaces.

B. **Fitness Level:**
- **High Performance:** Prioritize individuals demonstrating less lengths, indicating effective solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem, to increase the likelihood of producing a high-quality offspring.

C. **Crossover Compatibility:**
- **Effective Combination:** Assess the compatibility of your genetic representation with potential partners to ensure that the chosen crossover operator can effectively merge the genomes, maintaining valid the Traveling Salesman Problem routes. Do not limit yourself to these constraints, pick what fits you and your characterstics the best.
Save your trace and your mate trace, bracketed them with <sel> and </sel>.
2. Select one of the crossover operators based on above EC knowledge , use the selected crossover operator to crossover the two traces got in Step 1 and generate a new trace that is different from all traces, and has a length lower than any of these two traces. 
The generated trace should traverse all points exactly once. Save the selected crossover operator and bracketed it with <c> and </c>. Save the generated trace and bracketed it with <cross> and </cross>.
3. Select one of the Mutation operators based on above EC knowledge, use the selected crossover operator to mutate the trace generated in Step 2 and generate a new trace that is different from all traces, and has a lower length.
The trace should traverse all points exactly once. Save the selected mutation operator and bracketed it with <m> and </m>. Save the generated trace and bracketed it with <trace> and </trace>.

Directly give me all the saved selected crossover operator from Step 2, the mutation operator from Step 3, and the traces from each Step without any explanations.
The output format should be similiar with below, and the output should contain 16 iterations:

The user wants to simulate an evolutionary algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem for 16 iterations.
Each iteration involves three steps: selection, crossover, and mutation.
The selection step involves choosing two parent traces based on the criteria mentioned.
The crossover step involves applying either PMX or OX crossover to generate a new offspring.
The mutation step involves applying swap, insert, or inversion mutation to the offspring.
The generated traces should be different from existing traces and ideally have a lower length.

Let's break down the process for one iteration:

**Iteration 1:**

**Step 1: Selection**
- I need to select two traces from the provided list. The criteria are genetic diversity, fitness level (shorter length), and crossover compatibility.
- Let's pick the best trace `<trace>5,2,6,4,3,7,1,8,9,0</trace>` (length: 346) and a diverse trace with a decent length like `<trace>4,3,1,9,0,7,6,8,5,2</trace>` (length: 388).
- Save the selected traces.

**Step 2: Crossover**
- I need to choose either PMX or OX crossover.
- Let's try PMX.
- Select a random segment from parent 1: `6,4,3` (indices 2 to 4).
- Offspring starts as: `_ _ 6 4 3 _ _ _ _ _`
- Mapping from parent 2 based on the segment: `1->7`, `9->8`, `0->5`.
- Fill in the remaining slots based on parent 2: `7,1,6,4,3,8,0,9,5,2`. Check for duplicates: no duplicates.
- Calculate the length of the new trace `7,1,6,4,3,8,0,9,5,2`.
- Save the selected crossover operator and the generated trace.

**Step 3: Mutation**
- I need to choose a mutation operator.
- Let's try Swap Mutation.
- Select two random positions, e.g., 1 and 8.
- Swap the elements at these positions: `7,9,6,4,3,8,0,1,5,2`.
- Calculate the length of the mutated trace.
- Save the selected mutation operator and the mutated trace.

I need to repeat this process for 16 iterations, keeping track of all generated traces to ensure uniqueness. I will aim for shorter lengths in each step.
